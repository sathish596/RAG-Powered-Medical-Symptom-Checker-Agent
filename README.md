# Medical Chatbot using Machine Learning

This repository contains a medical chatbot built using a machine learning model trained on symptom-based medical datasets from Kaggle. The system allows users to input symptoms and receive predicted disease suggestions along with potential precautions. The goal of this project is to assist with early screening and improve accessibility to primary medical information. This project is for educational and research purposes only and is not intended for real clinical use.

## Features

- Natural language symptom input.
- Machine learning-based symptom analysis.
- Disease prediction based on trained models.
- Suggested medical precautions and treatment advice.
- Interactive chatbot interface (notebook-based or deployed UI depending on use case).
